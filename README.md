# cyber-toolkit

A collection of custom cybersecurity tools built for learning, exploration, and practical use. This repository contains small, focused utilities that demonstrate core concepts in network recon, scanning, and brute‑force techniques. Each tool is written in Python and is meant to be educational—feel free to study, modify, and extend them.

## ⚠️ Ethical Use Disclaimer

These tools are intended for **authorized security testing, educational purposes, and CTF challenges only**. Unauthorized use against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal and unethical. The author assumes no liability for misuse.
